# The equality condition for the Unbonding time in the message and parameters will block the registration of older stakes

# Overview

Staking/delegation transaction is registered using `CreateBTCDelegation` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-babylon/blob/main/babylon/x/btcstaking/keeper/msg_server.go#L198

Parameters of the message are checked in `ValidateParsedMessageAgainstTheParams` against global parameters relevant for a specific block. The function checks if the unbonding time in the message is equal to the unbonding time from the parameters of the specific block.

The issue is that the condition was different before (comment still points to older version). Instead of equality, the check was following:
```go
if uint32(pm.UnbondingTime) < parameters.UnbondingTimeBlocks {
```

If we want to register an older stake from phase-1, the parameters used for checks are obtained from specific older block where the stake was made (in case of parameters change), which is correct. However, the condition is different now. It means that before users could set the `UnbondingTime > parameters.UnbondingTimeBlocks` and now the staking transaction cannot be accepted because the time (in blocks) must be exact.

# Impact

We can see the docs and comments across the codebase describing `unbondingTime` parameter:
"_It must be smaller than math.MaxUInt16 and larger that max(MinUnbondingTime, CheckpointFinalizationTimeout)_"

The realistic scenario is a user who has set `unbondingTime = minUnboundingTime+1` to ensure that the transaction is accepted.
However now, due to a different condition, the stake cannot be registered even though all parameters were (are) correct and proof of inclusion has been submitted. As a result funds are locked and transition to phase-2 cannot be performed.

# Mitigation
Consider changing the condition for older stakes to ensure that all correctly formed stakes can be carried over to Phase 2.
