# Improper error handling in the CosmosSDK app

### Summary

The problem is that the protocol incorrectly handles error registrations.

### Root Cause

The `errors.go` file is located in the `x` module of the CosmosSDK app so it has to be compatible with the documentation:

https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.50/build/building-modules/errors#registration
```go
Each custom module error must provide the codespace, which is typically the module name (e.g. "distribution") and is unique per module, and a uint32 code. Together, the codespace and code provide a globally unique Cosmos SDK error. Typically, the code is monotonically increasing but does not necessarily have to be. The only restrictions on error codes are the following:

Must be greater than one, as a code value of one is reserved for internal errors.
Must be unique within the module.

```

The current implementation does not follow the rules indicating the abnormal behavior of the system.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Abnormal running of the system.

### PoC


https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-babylon/blob/main/babylon/btcstaking/errors.go#L1-10
```go
package btcstaking

import "errors"

var (
	ErrInvalidSlashingRate        = errors.New("invalid slashing rate")
	ErrDustOutputFound            = errors.New("transaction contains a dust output")
	ErrInsufficientSlashingAmount = errors.New("insufficient slashing amount")
	ErrInsufficientChangeAmount   = errors.New("insufficient change amount")
)
```

The same issue was reported here in the Allora contest: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-allora-judging/issues/82

### Mitigation

The issue can be fixed the following way:

```go
import (
    sdkerrors "cosmossdk.io/errors"
)

const ModuleName = "btcstaking"

var (
    ErrInvalidSlashingRate        = sdkerrors.Register(ModuleName, 2, "invalid slashing rate")         // âœ… Start from 2
    ErrDustOutputFound            = sdkerrors.Register(ModuleName, 3, "transaction contains a dust output")
    ErrInsufficientSlashingAmount = sdkerrors.Register(ModuleName, 4, "insufficient slashing amount")
    ErrInsufficientChangeAmount   = sdkerrors.Register(ModuleName, 5, "insufficient change amount")
)

```
