# Any error from `GetBTCDelegationRewardsTracker` and `GetFinalityProviderCurrentRewards` is interepreted as not found(i.e., key doesn't exist) , this could lead to incorrect state changes in case error throw is not due to the missing key


### Summary 
Due to incorrect error handling in `GetBTCDelegationRewardsTracker` and `GetFinalityProviderCurrentRewards` function, stakeholders may lose their earned rewards for a period of time. 

### Vulnerability Details 

During `x/incentive/keeper/msg_server::WithdrawReward()` call, the [`CalculateBTCDelegationRewardsAndSendToGauge()`](https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/babylon/blob/847bf148ca71374badf81676b258b812ec72337b/x/incentive/keeper/reward_tracker.go#L130) calculates the rewards of delegator based on the starting and end period, which later get updated to the delegator rewardGauge store via `k.accumulateRewardGauge()`. 


```golang

// CalculateBTCDelegationRewardsAndSendToGauge calculates the rewards of the delegator based on the
// StartPeriodCumulativeReward and the received endPeriod and sends to the delegator gauge.
func (k Keeper) CalculateBTCDelegationRewardsAndSendToGauge(ctx context.Context, fp, del sdk.AccAddress, endPeriod uint64) error {
	rewards, err := k.CalculateBTCDelegationRewards(ctx, fp, del, endPeriod)
	if err != nil {
		if !errors.Is(err, types.ErrBTCDelegationRewardsTrackerNotFound) {
			return err
		}
		rewards = sdk.NewCoins()
	}

	if rewards.IsZero() {
		return nil
	}

	k.accumulateRewardGauge(ctx, types.BTCDelegationType, del, rewards)
	return nil
}
```


The [`CalculateBTCDelegationRewards`](https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/babylon/blob/847bf148ca71374badf81676b258b812ec72337b/x/incentive/keeper/reward_tracker.go#L150) calculate the rewards accrued b/w the endPeriod and the `StartPeriodCumulativeReward` and returned it. It utilize `GetBTCDelegationRewardsTracker` to retrieve the info such as active delegated staked to fp, and the timestamp of last withdraw((i.e. `StartPeriodCumulativeReward`). 


```golang
// GetBTCDelegationRewardsTracker returns the BTCDelegationRewardsTracker based on the delegation key (fp, del)
// It returns an error in case the key is not found.
func (k Keeper) GetBTCDelegationRewardsTracker(ctx context.Context, fp, del sdk.AccAddress) (types.BTCDelegationRewardsTracker, error) {
	value, err := k.BTCDelegationRewardsTracker.Get(ctx, collections.Join(fp.Bytes(), del.Bytes()))
	if err != nil {
		return types.BTCDelegationRewardsTracker{}, types.ErrBTCDelegationRewardsTrackerNotFound   // @audit-issue
	}
	return value, nil
}
```

Note that in case the `k.BTCDelegationRewardsTracker.Get(ctx, collections.Join(fp.Bytes(), del.Bytes()))` get call, it may throw error, possibly due to Decoding/I/O issue, an error other than the `types.ErrBTCDelegationRewardsTrackerNotFound`. However, since default error types is considered to be `types.ErrBTCDelegationRewardsTrackerNotFound`, it  proceed wrapping up with `accumulateRewardGauge()` call with empty coins, along with `k.setBTCDelegationRewardsTracker` in upper function, which updates the last `StartPeriodCumulativeReward` value to a new value. The accumulated rewards for the `ending-starting` period is lost forever.   

Same issue in `GetFinalityProviderCurrentRewards`, which also has critical role in updating the fp rewards.  


### Impact
Loss of delegator rewads

### Mitigation 
Return err in case its other than the "not found" one
