# Non-determinism will result in a chain halt when using a mapping

### Summary

The iteration over a map will result in a chain halt.

### Root Cause

The choice to iterate over a map will result in non-determinism and therefore a chain halt. According to the CosmosSDK documentation (https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.52/build/building-apps/security-part-1#go-map-internals):

```go
When building on the Cosmos SDK, you should never iterate over a Go map. Doing so results in non-determinism. Instead, if map usage is inevitable, it is necessary to convert it to a slice and sort it. See an example here
```

The function `findLastBlockHash()` iterates over a `blockHashes` mapping causing a consequent chain halt.

### Impact

The chain will halt (which falls under high categorization according to the contest docs). There are some existing examples of the chain halt as a result of non-determinism. Here's an example of such issue (due to the map) in the `thorchain`:

### PoC

Let's take a look at the `findLastBlockHash()` functionality:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-babylon/blob/main/babylon/x/checkpointing/proposal.go#L244-249
```go

// Find the block hash that has the maximum voting power committed to it
	for blockHash, power := range blockHashes {
		if power > maxPower {
			resBlockHash = blockHash
			maxPower = power
		}
	}
	if len(resBlockHash) == 0 {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("could not find the block hash")
	}

```

It can be seen here that the function iterates over a mapping of `blockHashes`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-babylon/blob/main/babylon/x/checkpointing/proposal.go#L214-215
```go
// Mapping between block hashes and voting power committed to them
	blockHashes := make(map[string]int64, 0)
```

This will result in non-determinism as on different nodes the parameter `resBlockHash` will be a different value depending on when iterations start that is an array with the same power will return different `resBlockHash`.

Here's an example of the possible outcome:

```go
blockHashes := map[string]int64{
    "a3f1b2c4d5e6f7890123456789abcdef12345678": 500,
    "b7c8d9e0f123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef": 400,
    "c1d2e3f4a567890123456789abcdefabcdef1234": 200,
    "d4e5f6a7b890123456789abcdef0123456789abc": 300,
    "e5f6a7b8c90123456789abcdef0123456789abcd": 500,
}
```

### Mitigation

Slice the mapping first. An example from the Allora protocol code:

```go
// Generic function that sorts the keys of a map
// Used for deterministic ranging of maps
func GetSortedKeys[K cmp.Ordered, V any](m map[K]V) []K {
	keys := make([]K, 0, len(m))
	for k := range m {
		keys = append(keys, k)
	}
	sort.Slice(keys, func(i, j int) bool { return keys[i] < keys[j] })
	return keys
}
```
