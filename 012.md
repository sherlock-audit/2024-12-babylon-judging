# Genesis time is initialized with non-deterministic time.Now()

### Summary

Cobra commands initialize the genesis time with `time.Now()`. 

### Root Cause

The reason why `time.Now()` is considered problematic for genesis time is, firstly, non-determinism, the value returns the current system time that varies across the nodes. This creates inconsistencies when initializing a blockchain. Since it's a genesis time, its initialization is critical to the whole blockchain. If it's not the same across the nodes, it can fail to start or produce inconstent states:

```go
	// genesis args
	cmd.Flags().Int64(flagGenesisTime, time.Now().Unix(), "Genesis time")
	// blocks args
```

### Impact

Chain start failure in the beginning or it'll start to produce inconsistent states.

### PoC

According to the CosmosSDK documentation:

https://docs.cosmos.network/main/build/building-apps/security-part-1#invalid-time-handling

```go
Avoid using time.Now() since nodes are unlikely to process messages at the same point in time even if they are in the same timezone. Instead, always rely on ctx.BlockTime() which should be the canonical definition of what "now" is.
```

### Mitigation

Rely on `ctx.BlockTime()` which should be the canonical definition of what "now" is (Cosmos docs recommended mitigation) or choose a deterministic default value like this:


```go
cmd.Flags().Int64(flagGenesisTime, time.Date(2023, 10, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, time.UTC).Unix(), "Genesis time (Unix timestamp). Default: October 1, 2023, 00:00:00 UTC.")
```
