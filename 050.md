# Unbonding delegators can get slashed even after unbonding timelock expiry

### Summary

In Babylon, a delegator can unbond early, but can only spend unbonding tx after an unbonding timelock. This provides adequate buffer for the protocol to slash in case of violations. However, vigilante will slash unbonding delegators even if unbonding timelock has expired if the delegator has not yet managed to spend it.

### Root Cause

In Vigilante at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-babylon/blob/main/vigilante/btcstaking-tracker/btcslasher/slasher_utils.go#L427C5-L432C35 - the desired behavior of slashing is mentioned where expired timelocks should not be slashed just because delagator hasnt moved its stake yet

```go
// filter out all active and unbonded BTC delegations
// NOTE: slasher does not slash BTC delegations who
//   - is expired in Babylon due to the timelock of <w rest blocks, OR
//   - has an expired timelock but the delegator hasn't moved its stake yet
// This is because such BTC delegations do not have voting power thus do not
// affect Babylon's consensus.
```

However the logic just checks for UNBONDED status (with quorum of covenant signatures) without considering unbonding transaction timelock. 
```go
if strings.EqualFold(del.StatusDesc, bstypes.BTCDelegationStatus_UNBONDED.String()) &&
					len(del.UndelegationResponse.CovenantSlashingSigs) >= int(bsParams.CovenantQuorum)
```

Therefore unbonding delegators get slashed well beyond the unbonding timelock expiry even though they do not contribute to finality provider voting power.

### Internal Pre-conditions

NA

### External Pre-conditions

NA

### Attack Path

1. Delegator does early unbonding
2. Just after the unbonding timelock expiry, the FP is slashed
3. Delegator has not managed to spend the unlocking tx, gets slashed even though unbonding period is over

### Impact

Unbonding delegators can get slashed incorrectly causing loss of fun.

### PoC

1. Stake and then unbond a delegator and verify the delegator unbonded status

  start_height: 131
  status_desc: UNBONDED
  total_sat: "1000000"
  unbonding_time: 5
```

2. Wait till the unbonding tx timelock is expired. 
```go
time="2025-02-25T11:02:09Z" level=debug msg="Unbonding tx confirmed" blockHash=556fd95455f01e754344763944e65dda177731da8bdf0dadad8fd8dc574257f1 blockHeight=140 stakingTxHash=9fdcb9c2482b761ae22de5776510b22b5b6860d0a8eb8fbba5f17eefb15f8a7b unbondingTxHash=ec15210c7593055a45b4d89424ce83d4c4ab402b08f04a65ca5e0f59382e4755
```
Unbonding tx is confirmed at 140, its timelock should expire at 140 + 5(unbonding time) = 145 BTC height.


2. Slash the FP after the unbonding time has expired e.g. at height 164,  which is well past the unbonding timelock expiry (145). Observe that the delegator is still getting slashed.
