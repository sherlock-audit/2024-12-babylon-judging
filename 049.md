# Order of determining delegation status will cause inconsistent slashing for unbonding delegators

### Summary

Babylon node gives preference to unbonding status over expiration status for a delegation even though unbonding time is already considered in the expiration check. This status is used for determining the applicability of slashing. As a result, a delegator may experience slashing  if they unbond close to expiration time and their finality provider is slashed.

### Root Cause

In https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-babylon/blob/main/babylon/x/btcstaking/types/btc_delegation.go#L120
```go
func (d *BTCDelegation) GetStatus(
	btcHeight uint32,
	covenantQuorum uint32,
) BTCDelegationStatus {
	if d.IsUnbondedEarly() {
		return BTCDelegationStatus_UNBONDED
	}

	// we are still pending covenant quorum
	if !d.HasCovenantQuorums(covenantQuorum) {
		return BTCDelegationStatus_PENDING
	}

	// we are still pending activation by inclusion proof
	if !d.HasInclusionProof() {
		// staking tx has not been included in a block yet
		return BTCDelegationStatus_VERIFIED
	}

	// At this point we already have covenant quorum and inclusion proof,
	// we can check the status based on the BTC height
	if btcHeight < d.StartHeight {
		// staking tx's timelock has not begun, or is less than unbonding time BTC
		// blocks left
		return BTCDelegationStatus_UNBONDED
	}

	// if the endheight is lower than the btc height + unbonding time
	// the btc delegation should be considered expired
	if btcHeight+d.UnbondingTime > d.EndHeight {
		return BTCDelegationStatus_EXPIRED
	}

	// - we have covenant quorum
	// - we have inclusion proof
	// - we are not unbonded early
	// - we are not expired
	return BTCDelegationStatus_ACTIVE
}
```

The order for determining status of a delegation is (ignoring other statuses)
1. Check if unbonded early (returns UNBONDED)
2. Check if expired (returns EXPIRED)

A delegation is considered expired if the BTC height is larger than `endHeight-unbondingTime`. This is likely because there is no point of unbonding after such BTC height as timelock expiry of original staking tx will occur before unbonding tx timelock expiry. More importantly, such expired delegations do not contribute to consensus and are not considered for slashing.
However, if a delegator unbonds just before the expiration time, their status will be UNBONDED instead of EXPIRED after BTC height `endHeight-unbondingTime` and they will be subject to slashing.
This is an inconsistency in the protocol behavior (if a delegator unbonds early they get slashed vs not if they remain bonded for the same potential violation by their finality provider) and will result in fund loss for delegator due to unexpected slashing. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

NA

### External Pre-conditions

NA

### Attack Path

1. Delegator unbonds early close to expiration time
2. Finality provider gets slashed
3. Delegator which otherwise would have been in EXPIRED state and hence not slashed, actually get slashed because of being UNBONDED state even though they tried to unbond early

### Impact

Incorrect slashing of early unbonding delegator resulting in loss of funds.

### PoC

1. Stake and unbond close to expiration time. Verify the unbonded status during expiration time

2. Simulate slashing the FP during expiration time and see the delegator being slashed as well even though it should have been skipped by vigilante

```

If the same sequence of slashing is done without unbonding, the delegator is not slashed.


### Mitigation

Slashing should only be performed till BTC height smaller than `endHeight-unbondingTime` even for unbonding cases.
