# The implementation of `findLastBlockHash()` can cause proposal preparation and processing to fail

### Summary

The `findLastBlockHash()` function is implemented wrongly and can cause `PrepareProposal()` and `ProcessProposal()` functions to fail returning early with am error message.

As shown below, `PrepareProposal()` ensures there are no duplicate validators with ` baseapp.ValidateVoteExtensions()` on L93 

```go

File: .../babylon/x/checkpointing/proposal.go
068: func (h *ProposalHandler) PrepareProposal() sdk.PrepareProposalHandler {
069: 	return func(ctx sdk.Context, req *abci.RequestPrepareProposal) (*abci.ResponsePrepareProposal, error) {
070: 		// call default handler first to do basic validation
071: 		res, err := h.defaultPrepareProposalHandler(ctx, req)
072: 		if err != nil {
073: 			return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed in default PrepareProposal handler: %w", err)

//////SNIP
092: 		// 1. verify the validity of vote extensions (2/3 majority is achieved)
093: 	@>	err = baseapp.ValidateVoteExtensions(ctx, h.ckptKeeper, req.Height, ctx.ChainID(), req.LocalLastCommit)
094: 		if err != nil {
095: 			return proposalRes, fmt.Errorf("invalid vote extensions: %w", err)
096: 		}
097: 
098: 		// 2. build a checkpoint for the previous epoch
099: 		// Note: the epoch has not increased yet, so
100: 		// we can use the current epoch
101: 	@>	ckpt, err := h.buildCheckpointFromVoteExtensions(ctx, epoch.EpochNumber, req.LocalLastCommit.Votes)

```

However, when `buildCheckpointFromVoteExtensions()` is called, 
- Unbonded (removed) validators past extensions are used for evaluation and this can  cause the `PrepareProposal()` to return early. (the same path exists in the `ProcessProposal()` function


```go
File: .../babylon/x/checkpointing/proposal.go
123: func (h *ProposalHandler) buildCheckpointFromVoteExtensions(ctx sdk.Context, epoch uint64, extendedVotes []abci.ExtendedVoteInfo) (*ckpttypes.RawCheckpointWithMeta, error) {
124: @>	prevBlockID, err := h.findLastBlockHash(extendedVotes)

/////SNIP
130: @>	vals := h.ckptKeeper.GetValidatorSet(ctx, epoch)
131: @>	totalPower := h.ckptKeeper.GetTotalVotingPower(ctx, epoch)




213: func (h *ProposalHandler) findLastBlockHash(extendedVotes []abci.ExtendedVoteInfo) ([]byte, error) {
214: 	// Mapping between block hashes and voting power committed to them
215: 	blockHashes := make(map[string]int64, 0)
216: 	// Iterate over vote extensions and if they have a valid structure
217: 	// increase the voting power of the block hash they commit to
218: 	var totalPower int64 = 0
219: 	for _, vote := range extendedVotes {
220: 		// accumulate voting power from all the votes
221: 		totalPower += vote.Validator.Power
222: 		var ve ckpttypes.VoteExtension
223: 		if len(vote.VoteExtension) == 0 {
224: 			continue
225: 		}
226: 		if err := ve.Unmarshal(vote.VoteExtension); err != nil {
227: 			continue
228: 		}
229: 		if ve.BlockHash == nil {
230: 			continue
231: 		}
232: 		bHash, err := ve.BlockHash.Marshal()
233: 		if err != nil {
234: 			continue
235: 		}
236: 		// Encode the block hash using hex
237: 		blockHashes[hex.EncodeToString(bHash)] += vote.Validator.Power
238: 	}
239: 	var (
240: 		maxPower     int64 = 0
241: 		resBlockHash string
242: 	)
243: 	// Find the block hash that has the maximum voting power committed to it
244: 	for blockHash, power := range blockHashes {
245: 		if power > maxPower {
246: 			resBlockHash = blockHash // block hash that has the maximum voting power committed to it
247: 			maxPower = power
248: 		}
249: 	}
250: 	if len(resBlockHash) == 0 {
251: 		return nil, fmt.Errorf("could not find the block hash")
252: 	}
253: 	// Verify that the voting power committed to the found block hash is
254: 	// more than 2/3 of the total voting power.
255: 	if requiredVP := ((totalPower * 2) / 3) + 1; maxPower < requiredVP {
256: 		return nil, fmt.Errorf(
257: 			"insufficient cumulative voting power received to verify vote extensions; got: %d, expected: >=%d",
258: 			maxPower, requiredVP,
259: 		)
260: 	}
261: 	decoded, err := hex.DecodeString(resBlockHash)
262: 	if err != nil {
263: 		return nil, err
264: 	}
265: 	return decoded, nil
266: }


```


On L130 - L131 above the validator set of the current epoch are now being used (although there is no guarantee that this does not contain unbounded validators) but the `findLastBlockHash()` uses extension from previous blocks that may have been signed by validators that have become unbonded.


### Root Cause

The problem is that
- `findLastBlockHash()` can be evaluated using `VoteExtension` of currently  inactive (unbonded or removed) validators since the last or even prior blocks
- the `findLastBlockHash()` implementation also assumes there will be one block in which the cummulative voting power of extensions in that block exceeds 2/3 of the total power of all the extended votes (this will not always be true)

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-babylon/blob/main/babylon/x/checkpointing/proposal.go#L123-L124

### Internal Pre-conditions

The vote extensions of inactive validators are used for evaluation

### External Pre-conditions

NIL

### Attack Path

See POC section

### Impact

- Proposal preparation can be blocked since the this returns early with an error during the proposal preparation and since  validators do not prepare any proposal successfully then no block is created as there will be no proposal to process by the other validators
- Proposal processing can also be blocked

This vicious loop can proceed ad infinitum causing the chain to halt as no block is processed.

### PoC
There 2 scenarios:
For simplicity, consider 3 `extendedVotes`



```go

extendedVotes = [
    { ValidatorX.Power: 50, VoteExtension: {...BlockHash: "abc"} }, // signed in block N-2
    { ValidatorY.Power: 30, VoteExtension: {...BlockHash: "xyz"} }, // signed in block N-1
    { ValidatorZ.Power: 10, VoteExtension: {...BlockHash: "xyz"} } // signed in block N-1
]

```

**SCENARIO ONE**
An unbonded validator's (`ValidatorX`) vote is used

- this current `epoch` is 5,  and current block is N = 101 (which is also the `FirstBlockHeight` in this epoch)
- `ValidatorX` signed the extension at block `N - 2` = 99 in the 4th epoch and was unbonded (removed) in 100th block (becomes inactive)
- `ValidatorY` and `ValidatorZ` signed the extension at `N - 1` = 100 in the 49th epoch
```go
236: 		// Encode the block hash using hex
237: 		blockHashes[hex.EncodeToString(bHash)] += vote.Validator.Power
```
- on `blockHashes[abc]` = 50
- `blockHashes[xyz]` = 30 + 10 = 40
- `totalPower` = 90
```go
243: 	// Find the block hash that has the maximum voting power committed to it
244: 	for blockHash, power := range blockHashes {
245: 		if power > maxPower {
246: 			resBlockHash = blockHash // abc is the block hash that has the maximum voting power committed to it
247: 			maxPower = power // 50
248: 		}
249: 	}
```
- `maxPower` = 50
```go
requiredVP := ((totalPower * 2) / 3) + 1;
requiredVP := (90 * 2 / 3) + 1 = 61
```
- `requiredVP` = 61
- 50 < 61

```go
255: 	maxPower < requiredVP {
256: 		return nil, fmt.Errorf(
257: 			"insufficient cumulative voting power received to verify vote extensions; got: %d, expected: >=%d",
258: 			maxPower, requiredVP,
259: 		)
```
- an error is returned and processing or preparation is returned early


Notice that if we had used only active validators (i.e ValidatorY and ValidatorZ), the `maxPower` would be 40 and `requiredVP` would be `(40 * 2 / 3) + 1 ` and this will pass without issues

**SCENARIO TWO**
Same as scenario 1 but `ValidatorX` is still active (bonded) in the current block, the problem will still arise following the calculations above if the cummullative voting power of the blocks in which the extensions under consideration where signed are such that no one of them has 2/3 of the total voting power of all the extensions
Using the `extendedVotes` from above, `maxPower` will be 50 while `required` is 61 leading to `maxPower < requiredVP` and an error is returned

### Mitigation

I dont have a trivial solution but I suggest the `findLastBlockHash()` 
- using only validators that are present in the current block (i.e they had not unbonded as at the previous block)
- implemented such that if `maxPower < requiredVP` the blockhash of the block that has the highest voting power signed in it should still be chosen (this is to prevent early return with an error.
