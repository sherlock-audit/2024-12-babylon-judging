# Malicious fp can get more commission fee


### Summary

Malicious fp can get more commission fee by modifying the commission parameter

### Root Cause

It firstly update the `dc` during `finality/keeper.go#BeginBlocker` including `fp.commission` parameter, accumulate the previous block rewards inside `incentive/abci.go#BeginBlocker` then distribute the rewards during incentive module `finality/abci.go#EndBlocker` finally calling the `RewardBTCStaking` function:

```go
func (k Keeper) RewardBTCStaking(ctx context.Context, height uint64, dc *ftypes.VotingPowerDistCache, voters map[string]struct{}) {
    for i, fp := range dc.FinalityProviders {
		if i >= int(dc.NumActiveFps) {
			break
		}

		if _, ok := voters[fp.BtcPk.MarshalHex()]; !ok {
			continue
		}

		// calculate the portion of a finality provider's voting power out of the total voting power of the voters
		fpPortion := sdkmath.LegacyNewDec(int64(fp.TotalBondedSat)).
			QuoTruncate(sdkmath.LegacyNewDec(int64(totalVotingPowerOfVoters)))
		coinsForFpsAndDels := gauge.GetCoinsPortion(fpPortion)

		// reward the finality provider with commission
		// @audit - get the commission fee based on the coins and commission.
		coinsForCommission := types.GetCoinsPortion(coinsForFpsAndDels, *fp.Commission)
		k.accumulateRewardGauge(ctx, types.FinalityProviderType, fp.GetAddress(), coinsForCommission)

		// reward the rest of coins to each BTC delegation proportional to its voting power portion
		coinsForBTCDels := coinsForFpsAndDels.Sub(coinsForCommission...)
		if err := k.AddFinalityProviderRewardsForBtcDelegations(ctx, fp.GetAddress(), coinsForBTCDels); err != nil {
			panic(fmt.Errorf("failed to add fp rewards for btc delegation %s at height %d: %w", fp.GetAddress().String(), height, err))
		}
	}
}
```

The fp will get the commission fee based on the commission parameter, but it can be edited through [`EditFinalityProvider`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-babylon/blob/main/babylon/x/btcstaking/keeper/msg_server.go#L94) function at any time, so any malicious fp can works as normal at block `N-1` but update the `fp.commission` before/during `finality/keeper.go#BeginBlocker` to gain more commission fee such that its delegators would lose some rewards.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

### Impact

Malicious fp can get more commission fee by modifying the commission parameter.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Consider the commission parameter only changeable after rewards are distributed.
