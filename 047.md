# ResumeFinalityProposal can be Dos

### Summary

ResumeFinalityProposal can be Dos

### Root Cause

If the fp that requires jail has already voted, the `ResumeFinalityProposal` function will fail to execute.


### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

The malicious fp votes before the `ResumeFinalityProposal` function is executed.

### Impact
chain delay

### PoC


If the fp in the jail list has been voted, the `HandleResumeFinalityProposal` function will return failure, and the recovery block Proposal will fail to execute:

```go
func (k Keeper) HandleResumeFinalityProposal(ctx sdk.Context, fpPksHex []string, haltingHeight uint32) error {
    ......
	for _, fpPkHex := range fpPksHex {
		fpPk, err := bbntypes.NewBIP340PubKeyFromHex(fpPkHex)
		if err != nil {
			return fmt.Errorf("invalid finality provider public key %s: %w", fpPkHex, err)
		}
		fpPks = append(fpPks, fpPk)

		voters := k.GetVoters(ctx, uint64(haltingHeight))
		_, voted := voters[fpPkHex]
->		if voted {
			// all the given finality providers should not have voted for the halting height
->			return fmt.Errorf("the finality provider %s has voted for height %d", fpPkHex, haltingHeight)
		}
    ......
}
```

ResumeFinalityProposal -> HandleResumeFinalityProposal

A malicious fp (or the fp just doesn't want to be jailed) will vote before the `ResumeFinalityProposal` is executed.


The transaction of the fp vote can be in the same block as the transaction of the Proposal, or it can be a transaction before the Proposal.

Since the `ResumeFinalityProposal` requires the signature of gov, fp can query the Proposal transaction in advance.


Assuming that the Proposal takes one day from publication to execution, the attack will make the block recover for two days or more.

### Mitigation
If fp has already voted, remove fp from the jail list.
