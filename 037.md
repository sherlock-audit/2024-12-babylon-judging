# Votes cannot be extended and verified in the `FirstBlockHeight` of an epoch

### Summary

`ExtendVote()` will return early without extending any vote when called in the `FirstBlockHeight` of a new epoch

The same issue affects the `VerifyVoteExtension()` function too.

https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/babylon/blob/b5646552a1606e38fcdfa97ed2606549b9a233f7/x/checkpointing/vote_ext.go#L49-L52



### Root Cause

When `vote_ext::ExtendVote()` is called, it checks to ensure that the request is from the last or most recent processed height of the current epoch
```go
File: ...babylon/x/checkpointing/vote_ext.go
42: func (h *VoteExtensionHandler) ExtendVote() sdk.ExtendVoteHandler {
43: 	return func(ctx sdk.Context, req *abci.RequestExtendVote) (*abci.ResponseExtendVote, error) {
44: 		k := h.ckptKeeper
45: 	@>	// the returned response MUST not be nil
46: 		emptyRes := &abci.ResponseExtendVote{VoteExtension: []byte{}}
47: 
48: 		epoch := k.GetEpoch(ctx)
49: 		// BLS vote extension is only applied at the last block of the current epoch
50: 	@>	if !epoch.IsLastBlockByHeight(req.Height) {
51: 			return emptyRes, nil
52: 		}

```

This is to ensure votes are not extended from far previous blocks
However, there is a problem with this, if we look into the `epoch.IsLastBlockByHeight()` function, notice that it wrongly assumes an epoch will always have a last block (this is not always the case)

```go
File: ...babylon/x/epoching/types/epoching.go
52: func (e Epoch) IsLastBlockByHeight(height int64) bool {
53: @>	return e.GetLastBlockHeight() == uint64(height)
54: }

File: .../babylon/x/epoching/types/epoching.go
30: func (e Epoch) GetLastBlockHeight() uint64 {
31: 	if e.EpochNumber == 0 {
32: 		return 0
33: 	}
34: @>	return e.FirstBlockHeight + e.CurrentEpochInterval - 1
35: }

```

Notice that the `GetLastBlockHeight()` function does not take into consideration when the epoch is in its `FirstBlockHeight`

### Internal Pre-conditions

vote is being extended when the epoch is in its  `FirstBlockHeight`

### External Pre-conditions

NIL

### Attack Path

NIL

### Impact

- Vote Extension will be blocked and no vote is extended (i.e empty vote extension is sent)
- proposal preparation is also blocked because votes are not extended and this can lead to a chain halt
- Votes cannot be verified too

### PoC

- current `epoch` = 5
- `CurrentEpochInterval` = 20
- `FirstBlockHeight` = 101
- current block height = `FirstBlockHeight` = 101
- `req.Height` = 100
- `ExtendVote()` is called and `e.GetLastBlockHeight()` is evaluated as
```go
34: 	return e.FirstBlockHeight + e.CurrentEpochInterval - 1
34: 	101 + 20 -1 = 120
```
- the condition below evaluates to false and `ExtendVote()` returns an empty byte slice for `emptyRes ` and no vote is extended
```go
53: @>	return e.GetLastBlockHeight() == uint64(height) // 120 != 100
```

### Mitigation

- Consider modifying the `ExtendVote()` function to allow extension from the last block of the previous epoch when the a new epoch is in its `FirstBlockHeight`.
- When the `epoch` is in its `FirstBlockHeight`, `GetLastBlockHeight()` should return
```
FirstBlockHeight - 1 
```
