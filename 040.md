# The chain cannot be recovered after the number of stakers reaches 0


### Summary
When the total stake amount is 0(fp.totalVotingPower = 0), the block can never enter Finalized state and cannot be restored after being restake.

### Root Cause

### Internal Pre-conditions
1. At some point the total stake amount is 0.

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path
1. At some point the stake amount is 0.
2. Since the total voting power is 0, the block can never be Finalized.
3. The staker restakes BTC, but since the old block does not enter the Finalized state, the staked block cannot enter the Finalized state either.
4. `ResumeFinalityProposal` cannot recover this situation.

### Impact
halt of the chain

### PoC

When the number of votes is greater than 2/3, the block will enter the `Finalized` state:

```go
func (k Keeper) TallyBlocks(ctx context.Context) {
	   ......
		switch {
		case fpSet != nil && !ib.Finalized:
			// has finality providers, non-finalised: tally and try to finalise the block
			voterBTCPKs := k.GetVoters(ctx, ib.Height)
			if tally(fpSet, voterBTCPKs) {
				// if this block gets >2/3 votes, finalise it
				k.finalizeBlock(ctx, ib)
			} else {
				// if not, then this block and all subsequent blocks should not be finalised
				// thus, we need to break here
				break finalizationLoop
			}
		......
	}
}

func tally(fpSet map[string]uint64, voterBTCPKs map[string]struct{}) bool {
	totalPower := uint64(0)
	votedPower := uint64(0)
	for pkStr, power := range fpSet {
		totalPower += power
		if _, ok := voterBTCPKs[pkStr]; ok {
			votedPower += power
		}
	}

->	return votedPower*3 > totalPower*2
}
```

The problem is that if totalPower = 0, the tally function returns false, so blocks can never be `Finalized`.

This situation cannot be restored, even if `totalPower` is reset ina later block, since the previous block is not `Finalized`, the later block will not be `Finalized`.

The `ResumeFinalityProposal` is used to recover the abnormal block, but it also cannot handle this situation. The `ResumeFinalityProposal` removes non-voting FPs, but block still cannot be `Finalized` if `totalPower` is 0.

### Mitigation
```diff
func tally(fpSet map[string]uint64, voterBTCPKs map[string]struct{}) bool {
	totalPower := uint64(0)
	votedPower := uint64(0)
	for pkStr, power := range fpSet {
		totalPower += power
		if _, ok := voterBTCPKs[pkStr]; ok {
			votedPower += power
		}
	}

-	return votedPower*3 > totalPower*2
+	return votedPower*3 >= totalPower*2
}
```
