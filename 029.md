# totalPower's inclusion of the Jailed provider's voting power may result in a vote never reaching a 2/3 quorum

### Summary
totalPower's inclusion of the Jailed provider's voting power may result in a vote never reaching a 2/3 quorum

### Root Cause
totalPower's inclusion of the Jailed provider's voting power

### Internal Pre-conditions
There are providers being Jailed

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

### Impact
result in a vote never reaching a 2/3 quorum , blocks can never enter Finalize state and chains cannot work.

### PoC

The`AddFinalitySig` function is used to add the vote, but if the provider is in the`Jailed` state, this function returns an error.
Therefore, the Jailed provider cannot vote.

```go
// AddFinalitySig adds a new vote to a given block
func (ms msgServer) AddFinalitySig(goCtx context.Context, req *types.MsgAddFinalitySig) (*types.MsgAddFinalitySigResponse, error) {
	.......
	if fp.IsJailed() {
		return nil, bstypes.ErrFpAlreadyJailed.Wrapf("finality provider public key: %s", fpPK.MarshalHex())
	}
        .......
}
```

But the problem is that`totalPower` is calculated based on`VotingPowerTable` and does not subtract` Jailed VotingPower`:

```go
func (k Keeper) TallyBlocks(ctx context.Context) {
......
	// get the finality provider set of this block
->	fpSet := k.GetVotingPowerTable(ctx, ib.Height)

	switch {
	case fpSet != nil && !ib.Finalized:
		// has finality providers, non-finalised: tally and try to finalise the block
		voterBTCPKs := k.GetVoters(ctx, ib.Height)
->		if tally(fpSet, voterBTCPKs) {
			// if this block gets >2/3 votes, finalise it
			k.finalizeBlock(ctx, ib)
		} else {
			// if not, then this block and all subsequent blocks should not be finalised
			// thus, we need to break here
			break finalizationLoop
		}
......
}

func tally(fpSet map[string]uint64, voterBTCPKs map[string]struct{}) bool {
	totalPower := uint64(0)
	votedPower := uint64(0)
	for pkStr, power := range fpSet {
		totalPower += power
		if _, ok := voterBTCPKs[pkStr]; ok {
			votedPower += power
		}
	}

	return votedPower*3 > totalPower*2
}

```

`AddFinalitySig` can vote on multiple blocks, assuming that two blocks are voting at the same time,
The current block height is n+2, and the `VotingPowerTable` now contains the voting power of both blocks n and n+1.
provider votes for block n, at which point the provider is Jailed and his vote for block n is valid(block n is fine), 
But for block n+1 this provider cannot vote, the problem is that `totalVotingPower` in block n+1 has not subtracted the `VotingPower` of this provider.
If the provider has more `VotingPower` or if more providers are Jailed, the vote will never reach a 2/3 quorum.

It is very likely that the system will put lazy fp's in jail, and there will be a certain period of time, if there are many fp's in prison in the same period, if the total voting power is more than 2/3, the vote in that period may never pass, because the fp's cannot vote.


x/finality/abci.go/EndBlocker -> HandleLiveness -> HandleFinalityProviderLiveness

```go
func (k Keeper) HandleFinalityProviderLiveness(ctx context.Context, fpPk *types.BIP340PubKey, missed bool, height int64) error {
	......
	updated, signInfo, err := k.updateSigningInfo(ctx, fpPk, missed, height)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}

	signedBlocksWindow := params.SignedBlocksWindow
	minSignedPerWindow := params.MinSignedPerWindowInt()

	if missed {
		k.Logger(sdkCtx).Debug(
			"absent finality provider",
			"height", height,
			"public_key", fpPk.MarshalHex(),
			"missed", signInfo.MissedBlocksCounter,
			"threshold", minSignedPerWindow,
		)
	}

	minHeight := signInfo.StartHeight + signedBlocksWindow
	maxMissed := signedBlocksWindow - minSignedPerWindow

	// if the number of missed block reaches the threshold within the sliding window
	// jail the finality provider
	if height > minHeight && signInfo.MissedBlocksCounter > maxMissed {
		updated = true

		if err := k.jailSluggishFinalityProvider(ctx, fpPk); err != nil {
			return fmt.Errorf("failed to jail sluggish finality provider %s: %w", fpPk.MarshalHex(), err)
		}

->		signInfo.JailedUntil = sdkCtx.HeaderInfo().Time.Add(params.JailDuration)
		// we need to reset the counter & bitmap so that the finality provider won't be
		// immediately jailed after unjailing.
		signInfo.MissedBlocksCounter = 0
		if err := k.DeleteMissedBlockBitmap(ctx, fpPk); err != nil {
			return fmt.Errorf("failed to remove the missed block bit map: %w", err)
		}

		k.Logger(sdkCtx).Info(
			"finality provider is jailed",
			"height", height,
			"public_key", fpPk.MarshalHex(),
		)
	}

	// Set the updated signing info
	if updated {
->		return k.FinalityProviderSigningTracker.Set(ctx, fpPk.MustMarshal(), *signInfo)
	}

	return nil
}
```

### Mitigation
totalPower = totalPower - JailedVotingPower
