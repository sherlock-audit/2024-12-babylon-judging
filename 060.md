# Unfair reward distribution v2


### Summary

`HandleRewarding's` loop skips unfinalized blocks, but the reward is not redistributed after the skipped block is Finalized.

### Root Cause
The unfinalized block in the`HandleRewarding` function is skipped and no further processing is performed.

### Internal Pre-conditions
1. Multiple blocks are voting at the same time.
2. from current block to current - FinalitySigTimeout are in voting state (unfinalized),

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path
1. Some FPs did not vote in many blocks, resulting in current block to current - FinalitySigTimeout are in voting state (unfinalized).
2. gov removes the unvoted fp through `ResumeFinalityProposal` and reply the block.
3. FP that has already voted cannot get rewards.

### Impact
In some blocks, fp cannot get reward, which is unfair reward calculation.

### PoC
`HandleRewarding` is used to distribute reward, called when each block Endblock:

x/finality/abci.go/EndBlocker() -> HandleRewarding()

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-babylon/blob/main/babylon/x/finality/keeper/rewarding.go#L33-L35

```go
// HandleRewarding calls the reward to stakers if the block is finalized
func (k Keeper) HandleRewarding(ctx context.Context, targetHeight int64) {
        ......
	// targetHeight = heightToExamine = HeaderInfo().Height - k.GetParams(ctx).FinalitySigTimeout
	for height := nextHeightToReward; height <= uint64(targetHeight); height++ {
		block, err := k.GetBlock(ctx, height)
		if err != nil {
			panic(err)
		}
->		if !block.Finalized {
->			continue
		}
		k.rewardBTCStaking(ctx, height)
		nextHeightToReward = height + 1
	}

	if nextHeightToReward != copiedNextHeightToReward {
		k.SetNextHeightToReward(ctx, nextHeightToReward)
	}
}
```

The problem is that unfinalized blocks are skipped in this loop. After the`continue` statement,`nextHeightToReward`will be set after this block and the reward for this block will no longer be distributed.

**This will happen if from current block to current - FinalitySigTimeout are in voting state (unfinalized),**
This happens when many FPs do not vote in many blocks, and blocks that are not finalized will appear during `HandleRewarding`.

At this time, gov may need to use `ResumeFinalityProposal` to reply to the block and remove the unvoted fp, but the fp that has already voted will not receive any reward because `HandleRewarding` has already been executed.


### Mitigation
```diff
	for height := nextHeightToReward; height <= uint64(targetHeight); height++ {
		block, err := k.GetBlock(ctx, height)
		if err != nil {
			panic(err)
		}
		if !block.Finalized {
-			continue
+			break
		}
		k.rewardBTCStaking(ctx, height)
		nextHeightToReward = height + 1
	}
```
