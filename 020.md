# Refund mechanism doesn't make sure that there is a fee granter

### Summary

There is currently a refund logic that transfers the funds to a fee payer.

### Root Cause

The root cause lies in the fact that the transaction fees can be paid by other enitities and the funds are returned to a fee payer and not a granter.

### Internal Pre-conditions

-

### External Pre-conditions

Fee granter has to pay for the fees.

### Attack Path

Fee grantor paid for the fees but the funds are returned to a fee payer.

### Impact

Loss of funds for a fee granter.

### PoC

Consider the current refund mechanism:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-babylon/blob/main/babylon/x/incentive/keeper/refundable_msg_index.go#L10-23
```go

// RefundTx refunds the given tx by sending the fee back to the fee payer.
func (k Keeper) RefundTx(ctx context.Context, tx sdk.FeeTx) error {
	txFee := tx.GetFee()
	if txFee.IsZero() {
		// not possible with the global min gas price mechanism
		// but having this check for compatibility in the future
		return nil
	}
	txFeePayer := tx.FeePayer()

	return k.bankKeeper.SendCoinsFromModuleToAccount(ctx, k.feeCollectorName, txFeePayer, txFee)
}

```

The problem is that the fees are refunded to the `feePayer` (the sender of the message) without taking into account the fact that the actual payer can be `feeGranter` resulting in a loss of funds for the granter:


```go
type FeeTx interface {
	[Tx](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types#Tx)
	GetGas() [uint64](https://pkg.go.dev/builtin#uint64)
	GetFee() [Coins](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types#Coins)
	FeePayer() [][byte](https://pkg.go.dev/builtin#byte)
	FeeGranter() [][byte](https://pkg.go.dev/builtin#byte)
}
```


### Mitigation

Check out the Celestia solution for this issue:

```go
// getRecipient returns the address that should receive the refund.
func getRecipient(feeTx sdk.FeeTx) sdk.AccAddress {
	if feeGranter := feeTx.FeeGranter(); feeGranter != nil {
		return feeGranter
	}
	return feeTx.FeePayer()
}

```

Here the funds are actually sent to the right entity.
