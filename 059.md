# When verifying the proof in BTCUndelegate(), the BtcConfirmationDepth check was not performed.


## Summary
The `BtcConfirmationDepth` check is not performed during the verification of the `proof` in `BTCUndelegate()`, and if the undelegate transaction is rolled back, it will result in the incorrect deduction of vote power on the FP.




## Root Cause
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-babylon/blob/main/babylon/x/btcstaking/keeper/msg_server.go#L586
```go
func (ms msgServer) BTCUndelegate(goCtx context.Context, req *types.MsgBTCUndelegate) (*types.MsgBTCUndelegateResponse, error) {
	defer telemetry.ModuleMeasureSince(types.ModuleName, time.Now(), types.MetricsKeyBTCUndelegate)

	ctx := sdk.UnwrapSDKContext(goCtx)
	// basic stateless checks
	if err := req.ValidateBasic(); err != nil {
		return nil, status.Errorf(codes.InvalidArgument, "%v", err)
	}

	btcDel, bsParams, err := ms.getBTCDelWithParams(ctx, req.StakingTxHash)

	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	// ensure the BTC delegation with the given staking tx hash is active
	btcTip := ms.btclcKeeper.GetTipInfo(ctx)

	btcDelStatus := btcDel.GetStatus(
		btcTip.Height,
		bsParams.CovenantQuorum,
	)

	if btcDelStatus == types.BTCDelegationStatus_UNBONDED || btcDelStatus == types.BTCDelegationStatus_EXPIRED {
		return nil, types.ErrInvalidBTCUndelegateReq.Wrap("cannot unbond an unbonded BTC delegation")
	}

	stakeSpendingTx, err := bbn.NewBTCTxFromBytes(req.StakeSpendingTx)

	if err != nil {
		return nil, types.ErrInvalidBTCUndelegateReq.Wrapf("failed to parse staking spending tx: %v", err)
	}

	stakerSpendigTxHeader, err := ms.btclcKeeper.GetHeaderByHash(ctx, req.StakeSpendingTxInclusionProof.Key.Hash)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, types.ErrInvalidBTCUndelegateReq.Wrapf("stake spending tx is not on BTC chain: %v", err)
	}

	btcHeader := stakerSpendigTxHeader.Header.ToBlockHeader()

@>>	proofValid := btcckpttypes.VerifyInclusionProof(
		btcutil.NewTx(stakeSpendingTx),
		&btcHeader.MerkleRoot,
		req.StakeSpendingTxInclusionProof.Proof,
		req.StakeSpendingTxInclusionProof.Key.Index,
	)

	if !proofValid {
		return nil, types.ErrInvalidBTCUndelegateReq.Wrap("stake spending tx is not included in the Bitcoin chain: invalid inclusion proof")
	}

	//skip

	return &types.MsgBTCUndelegateResponse{}, nil
}
```
We observed that `BTCUndelegate()` only verifies the `proof` of the `StakeSpendingTx` but does not check whether the current BTC height and the height at which the `StakeSpendingTx` occurred have passed the `BtcConfirmationDepth`. Since transaction rollbacks can occur on the BTC chain, this check was implemented during the creation of the BTC delegate process for `StakingTx` in `getTimeInfoAndParams()`. However, the absence of this check in `BTCUndelegate()` will lead to issues.

Additionally, `BTCUndelegate()` lacks access control, meaning anyone can call this interface to report a `StakeSpendingTx` on the BTC chain, and the gas fee for calling this interface is also refunded.

## Internal pre-conditions


## External pre-conditions
`StakeSpendingTx` transaction rollbacks
## Attack Path
(1) The attacker monitors the BTC chain and calls the `BTCUndelegate()` interface to report a `StakeSpendingTx` as soon as it is included in a block.  
(2) If the `StakeSpendingTx` is rolled back, the FP's vote power on the Babylon chain will be incorrectly deducted. Additionally, rewards and other related calculations for this BTC delegate will also be affected and become erroneous.

## Impact
This issue affects the vote power and rewards on the FP (Federation Protocol), as well as the rewards for the BTC delegate.

## PoC

## Mitigation
The `BTCUndelegate()` submission is only allowed after the transaction has been confirmed by `BtcConfirmationDepth` blocks.
