# Slashing logic for finality providers does not work correctly in some cases

### Summary

The problem is that the current implementation of the slashing functionality allows finality providers to skip some blocks and not get slashed eventually.

### Root Cause

The root cause lies in the fact that the `minHeight` parameter is calculated the following way:


```go
	minHeight := signInfo.StartHeight + signedBlocksWindow
```

So if the `maxMissed` values is set to 1 or 2, and there is a `signedBlocksWindow` equal to 10, for example, the non-genesis finality provider can basically skip some blocks in the current `signedBlocksWindow` and avoid being punished for sluggishness even though he can vote for the next height after which he's been added.

### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

An attacker needs to be a non-genesis finality provider and skip the blocks

### Attack Path

FP can miss voting for blocks without being jailed.

### Impact

Some finality providers can escape voting even though they have to vote in the finality round.

### PoC

Consider the current implementation:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-babylon/blob/main/babylon/x/finality/keeper/liveness.go#L79-84
```go

	minHeight := signInfo.StartHeight + signedBlocksWindow
	maxMissed := signedBlocksWindow - minSignedPerWindow

	// if the number of missed block reaches the threshold within the sliding window
	// jail the finality provider
	if height > minHeight && signInfo.MissedBlocksCounter > maxMissed {

```

The FP is slashed in the case if the `height` is greater than the `minHeight` and `MissedBlocksCounter` is greater than `maxMissed` value. The problem is that non-genesis providers can start voting the one block after the `startHeight`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-babylon/blob/main/babylon/x/finality/keeper/liveness.go#L139-141
```go
	// A genesis finality provider will start at index 0, whereas a non-genesis finality provider's
	// startHeight will be the block they become active for, but the first block they vote on will be
	// one later. (And thus their first vote is at index 1)
```

So let's say there are the following params:


```go
signedBlocksWindow = 10
startHeight = 17
maxMissed = 1
```

In this case, FP can start voting at block 18. Even though the `maxMissed` parameter is set to 1, they can easily miss all the remaining blocks for this window even though the `maxMissed` value is set to 1 due to the fact that their `minHeight` is set to `startHeight` + 10 (in this example). They can then sign the blocks with such indices in the next window and decrement the counter.

### Mitigation

Consider implementing the special logic for the non-genesis finality providers.
