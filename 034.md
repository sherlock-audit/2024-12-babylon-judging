# Zero-Height Export Panics on Validators with No Commission

### Summary 
During a zero-height export, the migration code withdraws validator commission but panics on any error, including the `ErrNoValidatorCommission` error that is returned when a validator has zero commission. This inadvertently blocks the entire export process if even a single validator has no commission to withdraw, causing a potential chain restart failure.

### Vulnerability Details
In the snippet below, the code calls `app.DistrKeeper.WithdrawValidatorCommission(ctx, valBz)` inside a loop of all validators:
```golang
// withdraw all validator commission
err := app.StakingKeeper.IterateValidators(ctx, func(_ int64, val stakingtypes.ValidatorI) (stop bool) {
    valBz, err := app.StakingKeeper.ValidatorAddressCodec().StringToBytes(val.GetOperator())
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    if _, err = app.DistrKeeper.WithdrawValidatorCommission(ctx, valBz); err != nil {
        panic(err) // <-- Panics on ErrNoValidatorCommission
    }
    return false
})
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
```
If any validator has no commission, `WithdrawValidatorCommission` returns [`ErrNoValidatorCommission`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/0a98b65b24900a0e608866c78f172cf8e4140aea/x/distribution/keeper/keeper.go#L243), which in turn triggers the `panic(err)` line. This means a single validator with zero commission can derail the entire **zero-height export** process. Instead of continuing gracefully (or ignoring “no commission” cases), the code treats it as a critical error and panics, preventing a successful export.

### Impact
- The chain restart or migration relying on zero-height export may fail completely, as the export process will not proceed if one validator lacks commission.
- This effectively blocks upgrades, forks, or testnets derived from the chain’s current state.
- Operators who attempt to re-launch the chain using the zero-height export risk being unable to generate the required genesis file, creating downtime or forcing them to manually remove validators’ zero commissions before export.

### Mitigation
Change the error handling to specifically ignore or handle ErrNoValidatorCommission. Instead of panicking unconditionally on any error, check if the error is truly critical
