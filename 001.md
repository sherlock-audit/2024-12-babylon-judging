# If a block does not reach consensus even for a very short amount of time, babylon nodes will crash

### Summary

When a block does not gain consensus amongst FPs immediately (>2/3 vote on it), the chain halts due to reaching a panic in `tallying.go::TallyBlocks`.


### Root Cause

[`TallyingBlocks`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-babylon/blob/main/babylon/x/finality/keeper/tallying.go#L30-L72):

```go
	startHeight := k.getNextHeightToFinalize(ctx)
	if startHeight < activatedHeight {
		startHeight = activatedHeight
	}

finalizationLoop:
	for i := startHeight; i <= uint64(sdkCtx.HeaderInfo().Height); i++ {
		ib, err := k.GetBlock(ctx, i)
		if err != nil {
			panic(err)
		}

		fpSet := k.GetVotingPowerTable(ctx, ib.Height)

		switch {
		case fpSet != nil && !ib.Finalized: // [1] <-----
			voterBTCPKs := k.GetVoters(ctx, ib.Height)
			if tally(fpSet, voterBTCPKs) {
				k.finalizeBlock(ctx, ib)
			} else {
				break finalizationLoop // [2] <-----
			}
		case fpSet == nil && !ib.Finalized:
			k.setNextHeightToFinalize(ctx, ib.Height+1)
			continue
		case fpSet != nil && ib.Finalized: // [3] <-----
			panic(fmt.Errorf("block %d is finalized, but last finalized height in DB does not reach here", ib.Height))
    // [...]
    }
```

`tally`
```go
func tally(fpSet map[string]uint64, voterBTCPKs map[string]struct{}) bool {
	totalPower := uint64(0)
	votedPower := uint64(0)
	for pkStr, power := range fpSet {
		totalPower += power
		if _, ok := voterBTCPKs[pkStr]; ok {
			votedPower += power
		}
	}
	return votedPower*3 > totalPower*2
}
```

We see at `[1]` the normal case of an `fpSet` existing at a height and that block not being finalized yet. At `[2]`, we see that if the block does not reach consensus (`tally` returns `false`), we break and go to `finalizationLoop`.

Now at `[3]` we see that the case `fpSet != nil && ib.Finalized` causes a panic.

Putting these together in `Attack Path`, this will causes chain nodes to panic.


### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

* A block does not reach consensus immediately

### Attack Path

* `TallyBlocks` wants to finalize two blocks (`startHeight = (uint64(sdkCtx.HeaderInfo().Height) - 2)`)
* 1st block gets finalized (`block.Finalized = true`)
* 2nd block has less than `2/3` votes so it cannot be finalized yet
* We now start to iterate over BOTH blocks again
  * since `startHeight` is the same as before and we jump to `finalizationLoop`
* Since the block at `startHeight` is now already finalized but we have a `fpSet` for it, we enter the case `case fpSet != nil && ib.Finalized` which panics, stopping any node processing the block


### Impact

This will cause network nodes to crash and halt the network if enough nodes are affected

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider moving the tag `finalizationLoop` above the call to `getNextHeightToFinalize`. This would account for already finalized blocks (`finalizeBlock` calls `setNextHeightToFinalize`), preventing double-finalization.
