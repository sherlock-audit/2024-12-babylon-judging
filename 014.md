# Custom modules not supposed to used error code of value one, as it is reserved for internal errors in cosmos

### Vulnerability Details

The `Epoching` module utilize the error code 1, which is the reserved code value for the internal errors in cosmos sdk, 
https://docs.cosmos.network/main/build/building-modules/errors#registration 

### Impact 

Allowing custom modules to define errors with code 1 could lead to vagueness, If two different parts of the system (the core SDK and a module) were both allowed to use code 1, then it wouldn’t be clear whether an error with that code came from a fundamental problem in the SDK or from a module’s custom logic. Keeping code 1 off-limits for modules prevents such conflicts.

### Mitigation 
Avoid using error code 1
