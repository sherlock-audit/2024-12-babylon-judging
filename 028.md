# Unfair reward distribution

### Summary

`HandleRewarding's` loop skips unfinalized blocks, but the reward is not redistributed after the skipped block is Finalized.

### Root Cause
The unfinalized block in the`HandleRewarding` function is skipped and no further processing is performed.

### Internal Pre-conditions
1. Multiple blocks are voting at the same time.
2. The latter blocks are voted ahead of the previous blocks and enter the finalized state.

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path
1. Multiple blocks are voting at the same time, for example: h1, h2, h3.
2. h1 and h3 have been voted on(finalized), but h2 has not been voted on(unfinalized).
3. When `HandleRewarding`, h2 is skipped, nextHeightToReward is set to h3 + 1, h2 will not continue to distribute the proceeds, even if voted through.

### Impact
In some blocks, fp cannot get reward, which is unfair reward calculation.

### PoC
`HandleRewarding` is used to distribute reward, called when each block Endblock:

x/finality/abci.go/EndBlocker() -> HandleRewarding()

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-babylon/blob/main/babylon/x/finality/keeper/rewarding.go#L33-L35

```go
// HandleRewarding calls the reward to stakers if the block is finalized
func (k Keeper) HandleRewarding(ctx context.Context, targetHeight int64) {
        ......
	// targetHeight = heightToExamine = HeaderInfo().Height - k.GetParams(ctx).FinalitySigTimeout
	for height := nextHeightToReward; height <= uint64(targetHeight); height++ {
		block, err := k.GetBlock(ctx, height)
		if err != nil {
			panic(err)
		}
->		if !block.Finalized {
->			continue
		}
		k.rewardBTCStaking(ctx, height)
		nextHeightToReward = height + 1
	}

	if nextHeightToReward != copiedNextHeightToReward {
		k.SetNextHeightToReward(ctx, nextHeightToReward)
	}
}
```

The problem is that unfinalized blocks are skipped in this loop. After the`continue` statement,`nextHeightToReward`will be set after this block and the reward for this block will no longer be distributed.

That is likely to happen:

Because voting has a certain time period, the system allows fp to vote on multiple blocks at the same time.

Let's say there are three blocks voting: h1, h2, h3, their block Height is between`nextHeightToReward` and`heightToExamine`(HeaderInfo().height-k.geetparams (ctx).finalitysigtimeout).

h1 and h3 have been voted and are Finalized, but h2 is not, so the loop skips h2 and sets`nextHeightToReward` to h3+1,

When h2 votes yes, since nextHeightToReward > h2,`HandleRewarding` started from h3+1, so h2 will never be able to distribute reward.


### Mitigation
```diff
	for height := nextHeightToReward; height <= uint64(targetHeight); height++ {
		block, err := k.GetBlock(ctx, height)
		if err != nil {
			panic(err)
		}
		if !block.Finalized {
-			continue
+			break
		}
		k.rewardBTCStaking(ctx, height)
		nextHeightToReward = height + 1
	}
```
