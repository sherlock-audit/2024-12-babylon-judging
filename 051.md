# Due to the reward delay FinalitySigTimeout(even more) being accumulated in FinalityProviderCurrentRewards, the rewards obtained by a delegation might not correspond to the blocks in which it actually participated.


## Summary

All delegation rewards are calculated through FinalityProviderCurrentRewards, but there is no snapshot of the current block number.

  
  

## Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-babylon/blob/main/babylon/x/finality/abci.go#L43

  
```go

func EndBlocker(ctx context.Context, k keeper.Keeper) ([]abci.ValidatorUpdate, error) {

defer telemetry.ModuleMeasureSince(types.ModuleName, time.Now(), telemetry.MetricKeyEndBlocker)

  

// if the BTC staking protocol is activated, i.e., there exists a height where a finality provider

// has voting power, start indexing and tallying blocks

if k.IsFinalityActive(ctx) {

// index the current block

k.IndexBlock(ctx)

// tally all non-finalised blocks

k.TallyBlocks(ctx)



@> heightToExamine := sdk.UnwrapSDKContext(ctx).HeaderInfo().Height - k.GetParams(ctx).FinalitySigTimeout

  

if heightToExamine >= 1 {

k.HandleLiveness(ctx, heightToExamine)

  

@> k.HandleRewarding(ctx, heightToExamine)

}

}

  
return []abci.ValidatorUpdate{}, nil

}

```

We observe that when the `height` block concludes, the reward for the `height - FinalitySigTimeout` block is distributed through the `HandleRewarding()` function.

The issue lies in the fact that this reward is allocated to the delegations that were active during the `height`, `height-1`, `height-2`, and other blocks **after** `height - FinalitySigTimeout`.
```go
func (k Keeper) HandleRewarding(ctx context.Context, targetHeight int64) {

// rewarding is executed in a range of [nextHeightToReward, heightToExamine]

// this is we don't know when a block will be finalized and we need ensure

// every finalized block will be processed to reward

nextHeightToReward := k.GetNextHeightToReward(ctx)

if nextHeightToReward == 0 {

// first time to call reward, set it to activated height

activatedHeight, err := k.GetBTCStakingActivatedHeight(ctx)

if err != nil {

panic(err)

}

nextHeightToReward = activatedHeight

}

copiedNextHeightToReward := nextHeightToReward

  

@> for height := nextHeightToReward; height <= uint64(targetHeight); height++ {

block, err := k.GetBlock(ctx, height)

if err != nil {

panic(err)

}

if !block.Finalized {

continue

}

@> k.rewardBTCStaking(ctx, height)

nextHeightToReward = height + 1

}

  

if nextHeightToReward != copiedNextHeightToReward {

k.SetNextHeightToReward(ctx, nextHeightToReward)

}

}
```

Through `HandleRewarding()`, we observe that the rewards being distributed may correspond to blocks **earlier** than the `targetHeight`.
```go
func (k Keeper) rewardBTCStaking(ctx context.Context, height uint64) {

// distribute rewards to BTC staking stakeholders w.r.t. the voting power distribution cache

dc := k.GetVotingPowerDistCache(ctx, height)

if dc == nil {

// failing to get a voting power distribution cache before distributing reward is a programming error

panic(fmt.Errorf("voting power distribution cache not found at height %d", height))

}

  

// get all the voters for the height

voterBTCPKs := k.GetVoters(ctx, height)

  

// reward active finality providers 

@> k.IncentiveKeeper.RewardBTCStaking(ctx, height, dc, voterBTCPKs)

  

// remove reward distribution cache afterwards

k.RemoveVotingPowerDistCache(ctx, height) 

}
```
  In the `rewardBTCStaking()` function, the `RewardBTCStaking()` function from the Incentive module is invoked.
  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-babylon/blob/main/babylon/x/incentive/keeper/btc_staking_gauge.go#L19
```go
func (k Keeper) RewardBTCStaking(ctx context.Context, height uint64, dc *ftypes.VotingPowerDistCache, voters map[string]struct{}) {
	gauge := k.GetBTCStakingGauge(ctx, height)
	if gauge == nil {
		// failing to get a reward gauge at previous height is a programming error
		panic("failed to get a reward gauge at previous height")
	}

	// calculate total voting power of voters
	var totalVotingPowerOfVoters uint64
	for i, fp := range dc.FinalityProviders {
		if i >= int(dc.NumActiveFps) {
			break
		}
		if _, ok := voters[fp.BtcPk.MarshalHex()]; ok {
			totalVotingPowerOfVoters += fp.TotalBondedSat
		}
	}

	// distribute rewards according to voting power portions for voters
	for i, fp := range dc.FinalityProviders {
		if i >= int(dc.NumActiveFps) {
			break
		}

		if _, ok := voters[fp.BtcPk.MarshalHex()]; !ok {
			continue
		}

		// calculate the portion of a finality provider's voting power out of the total voting power of the voters
@>>		fpPortion := sdkmath.LegacyNewDec(int64(fp.TotalBondedSat)).
			QuoTruncate(sdkmath.LegacyNewDec(int64(totalVotingPowerOfVoters)))
		coinsForFpsAndDels := gauge.GetCoinsPortion(fpPortion)

		// reward the finality provider with commission
@>>		coinsForCommission := types.GetCoinsPortion(coinsForFpsAndDels, *fp.Commission)
		k.accumulateRewardGauge(ctx, types.FinalityProviderType, fp.GetAddress(), coinsForCommission)

		// reward the rest of coins to each BTC delegation proportional to its voting power portion
@>>		coinsForBTCDels := coinsForFpsAndDels.Sub(coinsForCommission...)
		if err := k.AddFinalityProviderRewardsForBtcDelegations(ctx, fp.GetAddress(), coinsForBTCDels); err != nil {
			panic(fmt.Errorf("failed to add fp rewards for btc delegation %s at height %d: %w", fp.GetAddress().String(), height, err))
		}
	}
	// TODO: prune unnecessary state (delete BTCStakingGauge after the amount is used)
}

```
It can be observed that the `RewardBTCStaking()` function in the Incentive module allocates the reward for the historical `height` block to each participating Finality Provider (FP) that voted. It then calculates the FP's share and the rewards for BTCDel. The rewards for BTCDel are recorded in the `FinalityProviderCurrentRewards` structure through the `AddFinalityProviderRewardsForBtcDelegations()` function.
```go
type FinalityProviderCurrentRewards struct {

CurrentRewards github_com_cosmos_cosmos_sdk_types.Coins `protobuf:"bytes,1,rep,name=current_rewards,json=currentRewards,proto3,castrepeated=github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types.Coins" json:"current_rewards"`


Period uint64 `protobuf:"varint,2,opt,name=period,proto3" json:"period,omitempty"`


TotalActiveSat cosmossdk_io_math.Int `protobuf:"bytes,3,opt,name=total_active_sat,json=totalActiveSat,proto3,customtype=cosmossdk.io/math.Int" json:"total_active_sat"`

}
```
The issue lies in the fact that `Period` is not tied to the block sequence number but is incremented by 1 every time operations such as `BtcDelegation`, `BtcDelegationUnbonded`, and `Withdraw Reward` are performed. This can be observed from the `BtcDelegationActivated()`, `BtcDelegationUnbonded()`, and `btcDelegationModified()` functions, all of which call the `btcDelegationModifiedWithPreInitDel()` function.

```go
func (k Keeper) btcDelegationModifiedWithPreInitDel(

ctx context.Context,

fp, del sdk.AccAddress,

preInitializeDelegation func(ctx context.Context, fp, del sdk.AccAddress) error,

) error {

@> endedPeriod, err := k.IncrementFinalityProviderPeriod(ctx, fp) 

if err != nil {

return err

}



@> if err := k.CalculateBTCDelegationRewardsAndSendToGauge(ctx, fp, del, endedPeriod); err != nil {

return err

}

  

@> if err := preInitializeDelegation(ctx, fp, del); err != nil { 

return err

}

  

return k.initializeBTCDelegation(ctx, fp, del)

}
```
It can be observed that the `btcDelegationModifiedWithPreInitDel()` function calls `IncrementFinalityProviderPeriod()`, which increments the `Period`.

```go
func (k Keeper) IncrementFinalityProviderPeriod(ctx context.Context, fp sdk.AccAddress) (endedPeriod uint64, err error) {

// IncrementValidatorPeriod

// gets the current rewards and send to historical the current period (the rewards are stored as "shares" which means the amount of rewards per satoshi)

// sets new empty current rewards with new period

fpCurrentRwd, err := k.GetFinalityProviderCurrentRewards(ctx, fp)


// skip
// initiates a new period with empty rewards and the same amount of active sat

@> newCurrentRwd := types.NewFinalityProviderCurrentRewards(sdk.NewCoins(), fpCurrentRwd.Period+1, fpCurrentRwd.TotalActiveSat)

if err := k.setFinalityProviderCurrentRewards(ctx, fp, newCurrentRwd); err != nil {

return 0, err

}

  

return fpCurrentRwd.Period, nil

}
```

The `btcDelegationModifiedWithPreInitDel()` function calls `CalculateBTCDelegationRewardsAndSendToGauge` to allocate previous rewards and invokes `initializeBTCDelegation()` to calculate the new total staked amount and the current reward rate.

Taking the `BtcDelegation` operation and `BtcDelegationActivated()` as an example, let's illustrate the issue. Assume the current block is the `k`th block:
1. When a `BtcDelegation` is activated, the `BtcDelegation TotalSat` is added to the Finality Provider's (FP) total staked amount, making it eligible for reward distribution.
```go
func (k Keeper) BeginBlocker(ctx context.Context) error {

// update voting power distribution

@> k.UpdatePowerDist(ctx)

  

return nil

}
```
2. In the `EndBlock` of the `k`th block, the rewards for the block at height `height - FinalitySigTimeout` (or even earlier blocks) begin to be distributed.

3. This `BtcDelegation` will participate in the reward distribution based on its share of the FP's total staked amount.

It is evident that this is incorrect because the `TotalSat` of this `BtcDelegation` did not contribute to the FP's historical block participation.



## Internal pre-conditions

  
  

## External pre-conditions

  
  

## Attack Path

 1. When it is discovered that a specific Finality Provider (FP) has voted on a historical block and is likely to receive a significant reward,  
2. Immediately staking a large amount of Delegation with this FP could potentially divert a substantial portion of the reward that originally did not belong to this `BtcDelegation`.  


## Impact
The reward distribution for BtcDelegation is unfair, as an attacker could exploit the system to unfairly benefit from rewards they did not contribute to earning. 
  

## PoC

  

## Mitigation
Modify the system so that a `BtcDelegation` can only receive rewards allocated for blocks **after** it has been activated.
