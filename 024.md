# totalPower's inclusion of the slashed provider's voting power may result in a vote never reaching a 2/3 quorum

### Summary
totalPower's inclusion of the slashed provider's voting power may result in a vote never reaching a 2/3 quorum

### Root Cause
totalPower's inclusion of the slashed provider's voting power

### Internal Pre-conditions
There are providers being slashed

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path
1. 

### Impact
result in a vote never reaching a 2/3 quorum , blocks can never enter Finalize state and chains cannot work.

### PoC

The`AddFinalitySig` function is used to add the vote, but if the provider is in the`slashed` state, this function returns an error.
Therefore, the slashed provider cannot vote.

```go
// AddFinalitySig adds a new vote to a given block
func (ms msgServer) AddFinalitySig(goCtx context.Context, req *types.MsgAddFinalitySig) (*types.MsgAddFinalitySigResponse, error) {
	.......
	if fp.IsSlashed() {
		return nil, bstypes.ErrFpAlreadySlashed.Wrapf("finality provider public key: %s", fpPK.MarshalHex())
	}

	if fp.IsJailed() {
		return nil, bstypes.ErrFpAlreadyJailed.Wrapf("finality provider public key: %s", fpPK.MarshalHex())
	}
        .......
}
```

But the problem is that`totalPower` is calculated based on`VotingPowerTable` and does not subtract` Slashed VotingPower`:

```go
func (k Keeper) TallyBlocks(ctx context.Context) {
......
	// get the finality provider set of this block
->	fpSet := k.GetVotingPowerTable(ctx, ib.Height)

	switch {
	case fpSet != nil && !ib.Finalized:
		// has finality providers, non-finalised: tally and try to finalise the block
		voterBTCPKs := k.GetVoters(ctx, ib.Height)
->		if tally(fpSet, voterBTCPKs) {
			// if this block gets >2/3 votes, finalise it
			k.finalizeBlock(ctx, ib)
		} else {
			// if not, then this block and all subsequent blocks should not be finalised
			// thus, we need to break here
			break finalizationLoop
		}
......
}

func tally(fpSet map[string]uint64, voterBTCPKs map[string]struct{}) bool {
	totalPower := uint64(0)
	votedPower := uint64(0)
	for pkStr, power := range fpSet {
		totalPower += power
		if _, ok := voterBTCPKs[pkStr]; ok {
			votedPower += power
		}
	}

	return votedPower*3 > totalPower*2
}

```

`AddFinalitySig` can vote on multiple blocks, assuming that two blocks are voting at the same time,
The current block height is n+2, and the`VotingPowerTable` now contains the voting power of both blocks n and n+1.
provider votes for block n, at which point the provider is slashed and his vote for block n is valid(block n is fine), 
But for block n+1 this provider cannot vote, the problem is that`totalVotingPower` in block n+1 has not subtracted the`VotingPower` of this provider.
If the provider has more`VotingPower` or if more providers are slashed, the vote will never reach a 2/3 quorum.

### Mitigation
totalPower = totalPower - slashedVotingPower
