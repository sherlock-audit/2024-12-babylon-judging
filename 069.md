# Excluding Mempool Data Enables Double-Spend Risk and Inaccurate Spend Detection

The issue originates from how the [IsUTXOSpent](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-babylon/blob/main/staking-expiry-checker/internal/btcclient/btcclient.go#L57-L71) function checks whether a UTXO is spent by calling the RPC client's **GetTxOut** method with the mempool check disabled. Here's the problematic code snippet:

```go
txOut, err := b.client.GetTxOut(hash, vout, false)
```

### Root Cause

The third parameter in **GetTxOut** is a boolean flag that determines whether transactions in the mempool (i.e., unconfirmed transactions) are considered when checking for the existence of a UTXO. In this case, passing `false` means that only confirmed transactions are checked. This creates a blind spot where a UTXO being spent in an unconfirmed (mempool) transaction is not detected as spent.
When a UTXO is spent in a confirmed transaction, **GetTxOut** correctly returns `nil`, and the function returns `true` (i.e., the UTXO is spent).
Suppose a transaction is broadcast to the network and is in the mempool, but not yet confirmed. The UTXO referenced by that transaction is effectively being spent. However, because the function calls **GetTxOut** with `false` for the mempool parameter, it ignores this unconfirmed transaction. **GetTxOut** returns a non-`nil` result, leading the function to incorrectly conclude that the UTXO is unspent.


Here’s a step-by-step explanation of how this bug comes into play:

- **Step 1:** A UTXO exists in the blockchain and is unspent.
- **Step 2:** A new transaction is created to spend this UTXO and is broadcast to the network. It enters the mempool but is not yet confirmed.
- **Step 3:** The system, relying on **IsUTXOSpent** to determine the availability of funds, calls the function.
- **Step 4:** The function executes:
  ```go
  txOut, err := b.client.GetTxOut(hash, vout, false)
  ```
  Since `false` is passed, the RPC call ignores the mempool.
- **Step 5:** **GetTxOut** returns a non-`nil` value because it sees the UTXO as unspent in the confirmed blockchain state, despite the mempool transaction spending it.
- **Step 6:** The function then returns `false` for the "spent" flag, incorrectly indicating that the UTXO is available.

## Impact
 If the system uses this function to verify UTXO availability before initiating a fund transfer, it might inadvertently allow the same UTXO to be spent twice—once in the pending transaction and again in a new transaction. This can lead to a situation where funds are double-allocated or even double-spent, causing potential financial loss or other unintended behaviors in fund management systems.

## Mitigation

To resolve the vulnerability, the function should include mempool data when checking the UTXO's status. This can be done by setting the third parameter of **GetTxOut** to `true`:

```go
txOut, err := b.client.GetTxOut(hash, vout, true)
```
